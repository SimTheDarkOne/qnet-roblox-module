# Welcome to the QNET Roblox Module.

This repositority is for the QNET Roblox banning module. You are free to clone this and port it into your game or directly use this. 

### A brief description about QNET:
QNET is an attempt by EramsorGR to unify the Roblox Sci-fi community a bit by making a shared bans database, to prevent exploits for joining games or toxic users! QNET is essentially a global database.

### Repo Information
There isn't much to explain here, your game **MUST** have HttpRequests enabled for the module to work! Other information and documentation is commented into the module code!
